# SwashSim

## Microscopic Traffic Simulation Software

SwashSim is a traffic micro-simulation tool that employs state-of-the-art software architecture. This architecture is object-oriented and built on the C#/.NET framework programming model, which allows for a high level of extensibility and modularity. The new architecture also supports a high level of fidelity with respect to temporal and spatial modeling resolution. SwashSim uses a 0.1-second simulation time step. One of the key features of SwashSim is the ability to model
individual vehicle characteristics and dynamics in great detail; thus, being able to account for the effects of roadway design features on vehicle performance with more accuracy than other simulation tools.

SwashSim is available (at no cost).

Note that SwashSim only runs on the Windows operating system and 64-bit CPU architecture. You also need version 7, or higher, of the .NET Desktop Runtime installed on your computer. The installation process should give you a warning if you do not have the required version of the .NET Desktop Runtime. But if you have any problem starting the program after installation, this should be the first thing to check.  You can check which version of .NET you have installed in your Programs and Features section of the Control Panel.  If needed, you can download the latest version, for free, from <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0">.NET Desktop Runtime download link</a>. On this page, find the section for the most recent version of the .NET Desktop Runtime. From there, select the 'x64' Windows OS option.

To obtain the installation files for SwashSim, please contact Dr. Washburn (swash@ce.ufl.edu).
