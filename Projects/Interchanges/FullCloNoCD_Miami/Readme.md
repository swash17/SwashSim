# Full Cloverleaf Interchange, without Collector-Distributor, Miami

This interchange form is modeled after the full cloverleaf interchange configuration that was recently replaced with a diverging diamond configuration, at SR-836/NW 27th Ave (Miami; Latitude/Longitude: 25°47'5.32"N/80°14'22.20"W). This interchange configuration is also very similar to one in Mountain View, CA (37°22'41.36"N, 122° 4'3.53"W). A key feature of this design is that it does not include a collector-distributor roadway for the freeway weaving movements. Thus, the ramp meter for the loop on-ramp must be placed on the loop portion of the ramp.
