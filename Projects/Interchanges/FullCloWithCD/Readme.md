# Full Cloverleaf Interchange, with Collector-Distributor

This interchange form is modeled after the full cloverleaf interchange in Fort Lewis, WA (Latitude/Longitude: 47° 6'15.13"N, 122°35'18.17"W). A key feature of this design is that it includes a collector-distributor roadway for the freeway weaving movements. Thus, the ramp meter for the loop on-ramp is placed downstream near the connection with the on-ramp lane for the arterial right-turn movement. This design provides more queue storage for the loop-ramp movement than full interchange design without a collector-distributor; however, care must be taken to avoid a situation where the queue blocks the loop-ramp exit movement.
